    // and updates the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph.
    // The graph is represented as an adjacency list, and the new vertex is represented as a list of edges.
    // The function should return the updated MST as an adjacency list.
    // The function should also handle the case where the new vertex is not connected to any existing vertices in the graph.
    // The function should also handle the case where the new vertex is connected to multiple existing vertices in the graph.
    // The function should also handle the case where the new vertex is connected to a single existing vertex in the graph.
