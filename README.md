# CS 3050 Final Lab: Spanning Trees and Graph Algorithms

## Instructions
Each problem is implemented in C. Compile using `gcc` or a similar compiler.

You must complete the logic in each `main.c` file and comment your code.

Submission: 
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone locally
3. Complete each of the five problems. 
4. For each problem, in addition to the code, submit: 
    - Your personal explanation of each choice you made in preparing your code: in a file `explain.md`, contained in that problem's directory. 
    - A short description (2-3 paragraphs) describing the utlity of the algorithm in that particular question: in a file `explain.md` in that problem's directory. 

## Problems
- `problem1_update_mst/main.c`: Update MST when a new vertex and incident edges are added
- `problem2_prim_kruskal_order/main.c`: Compare edge orders of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms
- `problem3_edge_in_mst/main.c`: Check if a given edge is in the MST
- `problem5_aug_data_struct/main.c`: Compute MST of an almost-tree (|V| = |E|)*
- `problem5_red_black/main.c`: Compute Bottleneck Spanning Tree*

**Solutions should be zipped up and submitted via canvas by 11:50pm on Saturay, May 17th.
